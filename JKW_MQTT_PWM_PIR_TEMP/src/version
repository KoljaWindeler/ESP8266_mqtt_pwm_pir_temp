			instead of "ON" send "ONFOR10" for 10 sec light

	- Enhance GPIO dimming feature
20180423
	- Enlarged dev_short to 50 chars
20180417
	- Added dimming capability to the gpio class
		-	set e.g. "gpio_2_brightness" to "50" [%] {default is 100%}
		- activate e.g. "gpio_2_dimm" to "ON"
		- if you need synchronous dimming:
			- activate "gpio_255_dimm" -> "ON,2,3,4,5" / "OFF,3,5"
	- Text size 393876
20180413
	- Added pwm capability to gpio class
20180408
	- GPIO class extended, provides output / input / input-hold capability
		- Config string GOP4 = GPIO, Output, Positive (active high), Pin GPIO4
		- Config string GIN3 = GPIO, input, Negative (active low), Pin GPIO3
		- Publishing limited to 9 Messages: devXX/r/gpio_X_hold with payload 1..9 (seconds hold)
20180403
	- Mesh Host SSID pattern: JKW_relay_dev99_L1 = opened by dev99 and Level
		one aka directly connected to the WIFI, next level would be L2 and so on ...
	- Configure Mesh options via Capability string M0/1/2/3 (Full, Host only, client only, off)
	- increased wifi connect time from 15 o 25 sec
	- explicitly set STA mode before connecting to any WiFi (test showed significant improvement)
	- explicitly set Mesh Channel on Mesh connect (again, way higher connection chances)
20180402
	- Added inverse option for GPIO (e.g. Relay shield is active LOW)
	-	No Mesh function added:
		- updated all nodes after having 20180310 on four nodes for a month
		- Had multiple disconnects / offline nodes
	- Added Mesh disconnect if no response is received within full "Timeout"
		- We send a PING to our Uplink when we haven't send a message for Timeout/2 = 70 sec
		- The uplink should immediately respond with a ACK
		- We disconnect when we don't receive an ACK within 140 sec
20180310
	- added peripheral husqvarna UNTESTED
	- text size 390460
20180303
	- added peripheral gpio
	- text size 386244
20180302
	-	Removed "uninterrupt check" from network receive -> relay msg as quick as possible instead of "after dimming"
	- Replace the generic Client mesh AP SSID with parent node name to enhance visibility of routing
20180227
	-	Added OTA via MQTT
		- Including MD5 and seqence nr checking
		- can be routed to single dev or to all "s/ota"
	- Changed MQTT buffer to 1024 (was 128)
	- text size 384716
20180225
	- Added station blacklisting
	- text size 382820
20180224
	- Added Mesh option
	- Wifi will try to connect for x seconds after boot or disconnect
	  After 0.8*X sec have passed: Try to connect alternating. Mesh and regular WIFI
	- If connection (no matter what kind) was established: Switch to WiFi station + AP
	- Start server on port 1883 to accept incoming connections
	- Send regular keepalive up, so each server can detected dead clients and disconnect them
	- Send "loop_detect" to see if I receive my own MAC from the net. If that happens: disconnect / no blacklist added as of now
	- Send routing message up the chain. Each node on the way will add its name so we get a nice tree
	- If we get data (from upstream) that we didn't consume, send it on to all clients
	- text size 381960 not optimized
20180206
	- reverted inital connect with timeout .. init connection fails too often
	- remove all wifi connections before connect to dedicated NW
20180120 *** (LTS tested)
