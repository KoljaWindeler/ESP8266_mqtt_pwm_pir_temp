	- Added station blacklist
20180224
	- Added Mesh option
	- Wifi will try to connect for x seconds after boot or disconnect
	  After 0.8*X sec have passed: Try to connect alternating. Mesh and regular WIFI
	- If connection (no matter what kind) was established: Switch to WiFi station + AP
	- Start server on port 1883 to accept incoming connections
	- Send regular keep alives up, so each server can detected dead clients and disconnect them
	- Send "loop_detect" to see if I receive my own MAC from the net. If that happens: disconnect / no blacklist added as of now
	- Send routing message up the chain. Each node on the way will add its name so we get a nice tree
	- If we get data (from upstream) that we didn't consume, send it on to all clients
	- TODO: if I connect to a AP that has 5 clients, my connection the the server will fail.
		But I'm still connected and even if not: the AP will still have the best RSSI value. So I'll keep Re-trying.
	- Overall status: In general working (tested with 7 clients in a row), rare crashes (probably fixed?)
	- text size 381960 not optimized
